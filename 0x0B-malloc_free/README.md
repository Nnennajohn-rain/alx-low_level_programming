Write a function that splits a string into words.

Prototype: char **strtow(char *str);
The function returns a pointer to an array of strings (words)
Each element of this array should contain a single word, null-terminated
The last element of the returned array should be NULL
Words are separated by spaces
Returns NULL if str == NULL or str == ""
If your function fails, it should return NULL
