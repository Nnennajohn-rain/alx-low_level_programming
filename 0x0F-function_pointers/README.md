Write a program that prints the opcodes of its own main function.

Usage: ./main number_of_bytes
Output format:
the opcodes should be printed in hexadecimal, lowercase
each opcode is two char long
listing ends with a new line
see example
You are allowed to use printf and atoi
You have to use atoi to convert the argument to an int
If the number of argument is not the correct one, print Error, followed by a new line, and exit with the status 1
If the number of bytes is negative, print Error, followed by a new line, and exit with the status 2
You do not have to compile with any flags
Note: if you want to translate your opcodes to assembly instructions, you can use, for instance udcli.
