Write a function that prints strings, followed by a new line.

Prototype: void print_strings(const char *separator, const unsigned int n, ...);
where separator is the string to be printed between the strings
and n is the number of strings passed to the function
You are allowed to use printf
If separator is NULL, donâ€™t print it
If one of the string is NULL, print (nil) instead
Print a new line at the end of your function
